# Fade-in on scroll

Just a little test for checking how elements can be introduced with CSS transition on mouse scroll (and window resize).

In short,

- with the support of JavaScript,
- listening for window's `scroll` and `resize` events,
- class names changed in callback based on screen/scroll position,
- CSS transitions defined for classes,
- hover is disabled to avoid hovering invisible elements.
